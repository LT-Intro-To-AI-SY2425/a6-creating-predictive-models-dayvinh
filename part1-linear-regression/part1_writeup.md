# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is how correlated the model is to the data which is a value of 0.62. This says that the model isn't a great representation of the data as a higher value means higher correlation in which 0.99 is the maximum value, but also isn't terrible as the lowest value is 0.00.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
According to my model, the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old is 136.5. 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I don't believe that this model's predictions are very accurate given it's lower r squared value, but I think it's accurate enough to predict someone's blood pressure based on their age as it is likely that their actual blood pressure is within a close range to what the model predicts. what could improve the model is a better line of best fit that is better correlated with the data values to ensure that the line is representative of the data.
